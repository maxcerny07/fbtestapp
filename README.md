# MovieDB App

## Summary
MovieDB App implements a comprehensive movie browsing experience with features for discovering top-rated movies, searching for specific titles, and managing a favorites list. The app delivers a smooth user experience with efficient pagination and real-time updates. While the core features work effectively, there are opportunities to enhance the architecture for better performance optimization.

## App Description
MovieDB App is an iOS application that allows users to browse, search, and manage their favorite movies using The Movie Database (TMDb) API. Users can discover top-rated movies, view detailed information about each film, and save their favorites for quick access.

## Required Functionality
The application includes the following features:
- **Browse Top-Rated Movies:** Users can view a collection of top-rated movies with pagination support.
- **Search Movies:** Users can search for specific movies by title.
- **View Movie Details:** Users can see detailed information about each movie including description, rating, release date, and more.
- **Favorites Management:** Users can add/remove movies to/from their favorites list.
- **Real-time Updates:** Favorites status updates across all views instantly.

## Technical Requirements

### Stack
- **UIKit:** For creating the main user interface with UICollectionView.
- **SwiftUI:** For the movie details view.
- **MVVM Architecture:** For organizing the codebase.

### Dependencies
- **SDWebImage:** v.5.21.3

### Deployment Target
- **iOS:** 13.0+

## UI Approach
The user interface combines UIKit and SwiftUI to provide an optimal experience:
- Main browsing interface uses UICollectionView for efficient movie grid display
- Movie details screen uses SwiftUI for modern, declarative UI
- Custom cells and reusable views for performance optimization

## UX Approach
The application consists of two main sections:
- **Feed Tab:** Browse top-rated movies with search functionality
- **Favorites Tab:** View and manage saved movies
- Pull-to-refresh for updating content
- Infinite scrolling for loading more movies
- Intuitive favorites toggle system

## Architecture Approach
The application follows MVC pattern with some modern practices:
- **APIClient:** Handles all network requests to TMDb API
- **ViewModels:** Manage data and business logic for each screen
- **Dependency Injection:** Used for providing shared services
- **Favorites Store:** Persistent storage solution for favorites using UserDefaults
- **Debouncing:** Implemented for search to reduce API calls

## Potential App Improvements
- Add more detailed filtering and sorting options
- Implement offline caching for better performance
- Add movie trailers and additional media content
- Implement more sophisticated error handling and retry mechanisms
- Add unit and UI tests for better code coverage
- Enhance accessibility features
